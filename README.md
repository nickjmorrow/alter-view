## Current State

This project is not at all finished, and I am not currently working on it.

## At a Glance

- The **front-end** is Gatsby / TypeScript.
- The **back-end** is Go. No strong reason, just wanted to play with Go.
- The **database** is PostgreSQL. I wanted something relational, even though this could probably be stored in documents.
